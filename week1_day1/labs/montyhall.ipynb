    "Implement the following game, known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem\">Monty Hall problem</a>, variations of which have appeared in real game shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "You as the player are presented with 3 doors, one of which contains the grand prize (e.g. a car), and 2 of them contain a junk prize (e.g. a goat), but you don't know which contains which.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are asked to pick one of the doors. From the remaining doors, the game master then opens one which contains a junk prize, and asks you if you would like to stick with the door that you picked earlier, or switch to the other remaining door.\n",
    "\n",
    "The door of your choice is then revealed, and you either win the grand prize or a junk prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Hints:_\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first part is very similar to the basic \"Guess my number\" game from the first lecture, when the numbers are between 1 and 3 (inclusive), except that you don't immediately reveal whether the guess was correct or not.\n",
    "- To find a door to reveal, you can use a `while` loop which picks a random door until the picked door is neither the door chosen by the player nor the door containing the grand prize.\n",
    "- After asking the player whether to stick with their choice or change, there are only two doors left. Some simple `if/elif/else` should be enough to figure out if the player won the grand prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're done, play it yourself for a couple of rounds to see if works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remark: In the 4th session, you will use your code to simulate many rounds of this game and figure out whether it's better to stick with your choice or change it."
